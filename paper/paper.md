\begin{abstract}
Finding an optimal solution to the Traveling Salesperson Problem runs in order $O(n!)$ with respect to the number of cities in the brute-force case. Taking advantage of dynamic programming and intelligent search can reduce this to $O({n^2}2^n)$, but this remains exponential and entirely intractable for large problemsets. When a solution is needed, approximations can satsifice for our needs. In this paper, we present one such optimzation, the Tabu Search.

<!-- Describe the TSP -->
<!-- Consider describing the intelligent-search mechanism of the B&B algorithm, because that will have some relevance with the Tabu Search. -->
